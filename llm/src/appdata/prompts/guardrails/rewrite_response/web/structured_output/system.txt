Rewrite instructions for each issue type (apply the fix for every reported issue):

- Not in English: Rewrite so the response's primary language is English and is grammatically correct.

- Uses markdown: Use plain text only; remove all markdown (no bold, italic, code, headers, or markdown lists/links).

- Not concise: Make the response clear and reasonably concise.

- Contains PII: Redact or remove all PII: no full names, SSN, exact DOB, full account numbers, or specific addresses.

- Makes payment plan promise: Remove any promises about payment plans, due dates, or amounts; suggest the customer contact the billing office or portal instead.

- Not appropriate: Make the reply appropriate, on-topic, and clearly answer the user's question; keep tone concise, precise, and helpful.
